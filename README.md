# Analysis of the factors of increasing global warming
## Introduction
Global warming is one of most critical enviornment challenges facing the world today. This study aims to analyze key factors contributing to the increase in global warming. 
The analysis focuses on identifying trends, relationship, and patterns in climate changes.

## Objectives
- To analyze long-term trends in global temperature changes
- To identify factors associated with increasing global warming
- To visualize relationships using scatterplots and time series plots

## Methodology
- data source: https://ourworldindata.org/
- Key Variables:
    Global average surface temperature
    Global CO<sub>2</sub> emission
    Global fossil fuel consumption
    Nitrogen fertilizers in agriculture

The study follows these steps:
  - Data cleaning and processing
  - Descriptive data analysis
  - Scatterplot analysis
  - Time series analysis to observe long-term temperature trends

## Data Visualization
### Scatterplots
- Used to identify relatinship between global warming and contributing factors
- Helps identify correaltion
- Check pearson correlatons for each them

### Time series plots
- Used to analyze temperature, CO<sub>2</sub> emission,Fossil fuel consumption, and Nitrogen fertilizers trends over time
- Helps to understand upwards and seasonal patterns

## Tools
- ggplot
- Tidyverse
- Minitab 16

## Results
Let's we see how be the descriptive analysis for Surface Temperature;
| Statistics | Values (&deg;C) |
|------------|-----------------|
| <p align="center"> Median | 14.30139 |
| <p align="center"> Mean   | 14.33021 |
| <p align="center"> Minimum | 13.84963 |
| <p align="center"> Maximum | 15.09097 |

There was the median surface temperature and mean surface temperature 14.30 &deg;C and 14.33 &deg;C respectivly.

### Boxplot of Global Surface Temperature

The boxplot summarizes the distribution of average global surface temperature values. There is an outliler, but we does not remove.
